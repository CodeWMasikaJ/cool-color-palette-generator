# Color Palette Generator

This simple web application generates random color palettes and allows you to copy the hex color codes to your clipboard.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
2.  **Click the "Generate Palette" button** to create a new set of random colors.
3.  **Click on any of the color boxes** to copy its hex code (e.g., `#A2B3C4`) to your clipboard.
4.  You can then paste the hex code into any application where you need a color value.

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the webpage structure.
* `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that generates the color palettes and handles the copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## How it Works

* The JavaScript code generates random hexadecimal color codes.
* These codes are then used to set the background color of boxes on the webpage.
* When a color box is clicked, the javascript copies the color code to the clipboard, and displays a message to the user.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to make this Color Palette Generator even better! Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* **Add More Color Options:**
    * Think about how we can let users choose the number of colors in their palettes. Maybe a slider or a number input?
* **Lock Colors:**
    * How can we add a lock icon to each color box so users can keep their favorite colors?
* **Display RGB Values:**
    * Let's show the RGB values along with the hex codes! Can you figure out how to display them when someone hovers over a color box?
* **Adjust Color Brightness:**
    * Let's give users the ability to change the brightness of their colors. Can you add sliders or buttons to make the colors lighter or darker?
* **Save Palettes:**
    * Imagine if users could save their favorite palettes! How can we use local storage to save them and then display them later?

If you have other ideas, we'd love to hear them!
